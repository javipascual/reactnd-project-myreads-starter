This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com).

To install the application, run

`npm install`

to install all the required dependencies.
Then, start the backend server by executing

`npm start`

this will open a chrome instance to the address `http://localhost:3000/`, which will run the app.
